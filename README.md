# 🤖 AI Engineering

Welcome to the **AI Engineering** repo – your launchpad for building production-grade, modular, and scalable Agentic AI applications using modern LLM tools and frameworks.

---

## 🚀 Goal

This repository is designed to help **developers, data scientists, and AI engineers**:
- Build, orchestrate, and deploy **AI Agents** using LangChain, OpenAI SDK, AutoGen, and similar libraries.
- Develop **modular, reusable pipelines** for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), prompt engineering, tool use, and multi-agent workflows.
- Integrate **guardrails, memory, and observability** to build safe and robust systems.
- Avoid model training from scratch – **this repo assumes you're using APIs or open models like LLaMA.cpp, Claude, or GPT.**

## 🧠 What's Inside

### 📂 `core/` – Core AI Modules
- `agents/` – LLM-based agents, tool integration, planning logic.
- `memory/` – Short-term and long-term conversational memory handlers.
- `prompts/` – Modular, structured prompt templates (for zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, etc.)
- `rag/` – Retrieval pipelines using FAISS, Chroma, LlamaIndex.

### ⚙️ `tools/` – External tools
- Web scrapers, APIs, custom toolkits callable by agents.

### 🔁 `workflows/` – Agent Workflows
- Multi-agent collaboration, planning & routing (AutoGen, CrewAI-style patterns).

### 🛡️ `guardrails/` – Safety & Control
- Output validation, content filters, role-based access, ReAct safety logic.

### 📊 `observability/` – Monitoring & Debugging
- LangSmith, tracing, logging, and custom dashboards.

### 📦 `apps/` – AI Applications
- `apps/streamlit/` – UI-based LLM agents (chatbots, assistants).
- `apps/api/` – Backend logic via FastAPI/Flask.

### 🚀 `deployment/` – Production deployment
- Dockerfiles, FastAPI setup, Streamlit hosting scripts.

### 🧪 `tests/` – Testing Framework
- Pytest cases, mocking strategies, CI-ready configs.

### 📓 `notebooks/` – Exploration Zone
- Jupyter notebooks to explore workflows, tools, or experiment before integration.

### 📁 `.github/` – Automation & CI/CD
- GitHub Actions workflows for linting, testing, and deployment.
